I refactored the project architecture by splitting the worker file into several
 files. I used the factory design pattern to create a factory of entities that 
 will be processed. This will help with the scalability, flexibility, and 
 extensibility of the project. It also modularizes the code, so each factory 
 worker will focus on its own entity.

I believe the code can be improved further by:
1. Creating more constants.
2. Extracting functions to remove duplicate code.
3. Validating if the logic that pulls the data of each worker can be improved to make them faster.

Additionally, unit tests are missing and should be added.
